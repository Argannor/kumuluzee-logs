> Lightweight open-source microservice logging framework for the KumuluzEE framework

KumuluzEE Logs is a lightweight open-source logging framework specifically designed for logging microservices. 

It provides easy and efficient logging of common log events, such as logging method entries and exits, logging external resource invocations and other events. It also provides automated logging of parameters and performance metrics. 

KumuluzEE Logs has been designed to simplify logging for the developer. It introduces a `@Log` annotation, which can be used on a class or on a method to enable legging the method entry, parameters, method exit and optionally include performance metrics. 

In addition, KumuluzEE Logs also support logging with explicit commands. It provides logging methods for the developer, which can be used in the code directly. 

KumuluzEE Logs acts as a fa√ßade and provides a simple, common interface with the objective to abstract the underlying logging framework. This makes the logging process easier for the developer, standardizes how the logging is performed, and makes the code independent of the underlying logging framework. 

KumuluzEE Logs is designed to support different logging frameworks. Currently, KumuluzEE Logs provides support for Log4J2 and java.util.logging (JUL). In the future, other logging frameworks will be supported too (contributions are welcome).

To address the needs specific to logging microservices, KumuluzEE Logs can be easily configured to collect distributed logs into a centralized log management system, such as Elastic Stack, Graylog, Splunk, etc. Furthermore, KumuluzEE Logs provides support for Apache Kafka and other approaches. 

## Usage
KumuluzEE defines interfaces for common logging features. Therefore, to use the logging you need to include a dependency to implementation library. Currently, Log4j2 and JUL are supported. Log4j2 is more appropriate for complex and enterprise grade logging scenarios, while JUL is adequate for simpler logging.

To use KumuluzEE Logs with Log4j2, use the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
   <artifactId>kumuluzee-logs-log4j2</artifactId>
   <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.logs</groupId>
   <version>${kumuluzee-logs.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

To use KumuluzEE Logs with JUL, use the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
   <artifactId>kumuluzee-logs-jul</artifactId>
   <groupId>com.kumuluz.ee.logs</groupId>
   <version>${kumuluzee-logs.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

You can use one dependency only. You cannot use both dependencies at the same time.


## Developer Logging

To use the developer logging functionality get a new `Logger` instance by using `LogManager`:

```java
private static final Logger LOG = LogManager.getLogger(CustomerResourceSample.class.getName());
```

Logger defines multiple overloaded methods for each logging level (error, warning, info, debug, trace), for example:

```java
LOG.trace("Trace log with String only");
LOG.info("Info log with parameter: {}", someVariable);
LOG.error("Error with exception log", exception);
LOG.error(exception); //exception only
```

## Common Logging

Additional common logging is available through `LogCommons` interface, method entry and method exit logging can be used by using `@Log` annotation used at class level or method level or by invoking the methods manually. Resource logging can be used only by manual method invocation.

Example for using `@Log` at Class level:

```java 
@Log
public class SomeClass {
    //Implementation
}
```

You can define additional attributes in `@Log` annotation for monitoring method execution duration and disabling method invocation details. Observe three different possibilities for configuring method entry and exit logging:


```java
@Log
@Log(LogParams.METRICS)
@Log(value = LogParams.METRICS, methodCall = false)
```

## JAX-RS method entry and exit Logging

Additional common logging is available through `LogCommons` interface, method entry and method exit logging can be used by using `@Log` annotation used at class level or method level or by invoking the methods manually. Resource logging can be used only by manual method invocation.

Example for using `@Log` at Class level:

```java 
@Path("customers")
@Log
public class CustomerResource {
    //Implementation
}
```

You can define additional attributes in `@Log` annotation for monitoring method execution duration and disabling method invocation details. Observe three different possibilities for configuring method entry and exit logging:

```java
@Log
@Log(LogParams.METRICS)
@Log(value = LogParams.METRICS, methodCall = false)
```


## Resource invocation logging

Additional functionality of `LogCommons` implementation is the ability to log and monitor invocations of external resources, for example databases and services. Resource monitoring allows you to log resource parameters and performance metrics. This functionality is available only through manual invocation of `LogCommons` methods.

Sample code of resource invocation monitoring:

```java
LogResourceContext context = logCommons.logResourceStart(
    LogLevel.TRACE,
    Marker.DATABASE,
    new LogResourceMessage().enableInvoke(invokeMessage).enableMetrics());

//...Read resource by id

logCommons.logResourceEnd(context);
```

In the sample above, we invoke `logResourceStart` method, with parameters:
* LogLevel, which specifies different log levels (TRACE, ERROR, DEBUG...).
* Marker, which is an enum, implementing interface `com.kumuluz.ee.logs.markers.Marker`. You should implement Markers according to your needs.
* New `LogResourceMessage` instance, where we set the invocation message (see below) and enable metrics monitoring.

`logResourceStart` method returns `LogResourceContext` instance, which passes relavant information for logging end of resource invocation.

`InvokeMessage` variable is an instsance of `com.kumuluz.ee.logs.messages.ResourceInvokeLogMessage` interface and therefore must implement a method which returns a Map (`Map<String, String>`) of parameters. For example, the sample of InvocationMessage could be used to populate the Map the in the following way:

```java
InvocationMessage invokeMessage = new InvocationMessage("Invocation of database resource").
    addName("User").addParameter("id",id);
```


## Configuring KumuluzEE Logs with KumuluzEE Config

KumuluzEE Logs use the KumuluzEE Config framework to provide configuration of the logging framework. The following options are available:
* Loggers with names and levels
* Config file content
* Config file location

Configuration can be provided at startup or runtime. For runtime configuration, you have to use the KumuluzEE Config project for config servers (etcd or Consul).

### Loggers

Logger levels can be configured individually using the `kumuluzee.logs.loggers` config property:

```yaml
kumuluzee:
  logs:
    loggers:
      - name: com.kumuluz.ee.samples.kumuluzee_logs.CustomerResource
        level: TRACE
      - name: ''
        level: INFO

```

The root logger can be referenced by providing an empty string ('') or a combination of whitespaces (useful for Consul), which will be trimmed to an empty string.

### Config file content

Instead of using the config file in the file system, which might be inappropriate for microservices, the content of the config file can be provided within the `kumuluzee.logs.config-file` config property, as shown below for Log4j2. You can provide config properties for JUL in the same way.

```yaml
kumuluzee:
  logs:
    config-file: '<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
                  <Configuration name="customers">
                      <Appenders>
                          <Console name="console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
                              <PatternLayout pattern="%d %p %marker %m %X %ex %n"/>
                          </Console>
                      </Appenders>
                      <Loggers>                 
                          <!-- Default logger -->
                          <Root level="info">
                              <AppenderRef ref="console"/>
                          </Root>
                      </Loggers>
                  </Configuration>'
```

### Config file location

If you prefer to use the config file in the file system, you can specify the config file location using the `kumuluzee.logs.config-file-location` config property:

```yaml
kumuluzee:
  logs:
    config-file-location: /home/kumuluz/kumuluzee-samples/kumuluzee-logs-log4j2/src/main/resources/log4j2.xml
```

At startup, if both `kumuluzee.logs.config-file` and `kumuluzee.logs.config-file-location` are provided the `kumuluzee.logs.config-file` will have priority. When configuring with Consul this is not the the case since the last sent value will have priority.

## Config file for Log4j2

The configuration for the Log4j2 library must be available for the application to load it. Please refer to Log4j2 documentation for rules regarding how the configuration is loaded. Configuration should be in the file named `log4j2.xml`, which is located by default in `src/main/resources`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration name="config-name">
    <Appenders>
        <Console name="console" target="SYSTEM_OUT">
            <PatternLayout pattern="%d %p %marker %m %X %ex %n"/>
        </Console>
    </Appenders>
    <Loggers>
        <Root level="info">
            <AppenderRef ref="console"/>
        </Root>
    </Loggers>
</Configuration>
```

## Config file for JUL

The configuration for JUL library will be loaded from the JRE logging.properties file. You can however provide your own logging.properties configuration file and enabling it by providing `-Djava.util.logging.config.file` system property. Sample configuration, which should be in a file named `logging.properties` and located in `src/main/resources`:

```
# Default global logging level
.level=FINER

# ConsoleHandler definition
handlers=java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# ConsoleHandler configuration settings
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level=FINER
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.formatter=java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter
```
